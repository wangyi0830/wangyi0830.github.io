Hello!I'm Wang Yi, a Tourism Management graduate from Anhui Agricultural University.After graduation, I joined the navy, where l learned teamwork and discipline.Digital marketing is the future trend and my passion. I believe that the field of digital marketing requires talents who are proficient in data analysis and have a deep understanding of human values. I also look forward to being inspired by the spirit of Nanjing University's motto, "Honesty, Simplicity, Grandeur, and Diligence in Learning and Practice", and in the future, to integrate the user behavior analysis and data mining skills from the field of economics and management, the political acumen and teamwork awareness gained from my military experience, and the practical communication experience from the industry, to explore more possibilities in the field of digital marketing.
