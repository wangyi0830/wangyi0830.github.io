Hello! I’m Wang Yi, a Tourism Management graduate from Anhui Agricultural University. After graduation, I joined the Chinese Navy, where l have learned some important experience such as teamwork and discipline. Digital marketing is not only a future trend but also my area of interest. I believe that the field of digital marketing requires versatile talents who combine data-driven insights with humanistic care. Inspired by the spirit of Nanjing University’s motto, “Sincerity with Aspiration, Perseverance with Integrity”, I look forward to integrating user behavior analysis and data mining skills from the field of economics and management, the political acumen and teamwork awareness gained from my military training, and the practical communication experience gained in the industry, so as to explore more possibilities in the realm of digital marketing.
